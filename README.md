# ioTactile Games

iotactile Games was born out of the void left by the end of Adobe Flash Player, which led to the closure of many online gaming sites.

This project is an online or solo gaming site that offers and will offer many games that are close to my heart.

The first game I've created is Dice, a dice game for up to 4 players. My second game is Minesweeper, a solo game. The third one is Takuzu, another solo game.

This site is my sandbox, where I put my knowledge and ideas into practice. I experiment and learn new things as the project progresses.
